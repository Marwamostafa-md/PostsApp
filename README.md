## ðŸ§± Clean Architecture Layers

The project is divided into 3 main layers:

1. **Presentation Layer**:
   - Responsible for the UI.
   - Uses `Bloc` for state management.

2. **Domain Layer**:
   - Contains `UseCases`, `Entities`, and abstract `Repositories`.

3. **Data Layer**:
   - Includes:
     - `RemoteDataSource`: Fetches data from the internet.
     - `LocalDataSource`: Handles local caching.
     - `Models`: Transforms data between layers.
     - `RepositoryImpl`: Implements the business logic.

## ðŸ’¾ Local Caching with SQLite

- The app uses **sqflite** to cache posts locally after the first fetch.
- On the next app launch, data is loaded from the local database if no internet connection is available.
- The caching is implemented in `LocalDataSourceImpl`.
